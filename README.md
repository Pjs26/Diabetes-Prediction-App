# Diabetes-Prediction-App
Diabetes, a chronic disorder marked by high blood sugar, can lead to severe complications. Early detection and management are crucial. This project uses machine learning to predict diabetes risk, leveraging a Kaggle dataset with features like glucose levels, BMI, and age. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and feature selection. Various algorithms, such as logistic regression and random forests, are trained and optimized. The model's performance is evaluated on an independent test set, providing insights into the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting diabetes and its potential in advancing personalized healthcare and early disease detection.
